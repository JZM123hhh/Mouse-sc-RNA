To investigate the role of MAGI3 in shaping the tumor immune microenvironment, we subcutaneously implanted MC38-Vector (control) and MC38-MAGI3 (overexpression) cells into C57BL/6 mice. Single-cell RNA sequencing resolved the tumor ecosystem into four major compartments: malignant epithelial cells, fibroblasts, myeloid cells, and lymphoid cells. Subclustering of tumor epithelium revealed that MAGI3 suppressed CCL2 transcription and STAT3 activity.
Analysis of the myeloid compartment identified distinct macrophage subpopulations based on canonical marker genes. Subclassification using established M1/M2 markers and M2 signature scoring confirmed populations of monocytes, M1 macrophages, and M2 macrophages. MAGI3 overexpression significantly decreased the proportion of M2 macrophages while increasing M1 macrophages within tumors.
Trajectory analysis revealed that monocytes normally bifurcate into M1 and M2 subsets; however, MAGI3 overexpression biased differentiation toward M1, reducing M2 commitment.
Along this trajectory, MAGI3-overexpressing tumors—relative to controls—showed an abrupt downregulation of M2 markers (Mrc1, Arg1) at terminal pseudotime states, accompanied by upregulation of the M1 marker Il1b. Taken together, these findings demonstrate at single-cell resolution that MAGI3 inhibits M2 macrophage recruitment and reprograms macrophage polarization away from the M2 phenotype.
